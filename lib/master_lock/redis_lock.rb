  # RedisLock implements a mutex in Redis according to the strategy documented
  # at http://redis.io/commands/SET#patterns. The lock has a string identifier
  # and when acquired will be registered to an owner, also identified by a
  # string. Locks have an expiration time, after which they will be released
  # automatically so that unexpected failures do not result in locks getting
  # stuck.
